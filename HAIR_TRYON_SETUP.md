## Pricing

## Testing

### Test Preview Mode (Works Now):
1. Go to your LineUp app
2. Upload a photo
3. Click "Try On Style" on any haircut recommendation
4. See your photo with style name overlay!

### Test AI Mode (After adding token):
1. Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` to Render
2. Wait for deploy
3. Upload photo and try style
4. See AI-enhanced result!

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to process try-on"
- **Solution**: The fallback preview mode will work automatically
- Image might be too large (keep under 5MB)

### Want even better results?
**Option A**: Use a better Replicate model (costs more):
```python
# In app.py, change the model to:
output = replicate.run(
    "cjwbw/roop:b9e4ab0104ab5d94c4f5f04d57e0e113dc4b77d7cf1c0f186a29f0d0cf58f045",
    input={"target_image": image_url, ...}
)
```

**Option B**: Use Hugging Face Spaces (FREE but slower):
- Create HF account at https://huggingface.co
- Deploy a face swap Space
- Update the endpoint in app.py
